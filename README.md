# 🍿 usePopcorn - Movie Information App

usePopcorn is a React project that allows users to search for movie titles and view their details using the www.omdbapi.com API. Users can click on any movie to see comprehensive information such as release year, cast, IMDb rating, director, plot summary, and more. Additionally, the app features a star rating component that enables users to rate movies and add them to their "Watched Movies" list. This list is stored in the local storage, so even if the page is refreshed, the data remains intact, allowing users to keep track of the movies they've watched along with their ratings.
